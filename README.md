Hey there!

I'm Mason, and I'm currently studying at UNC Chapel Hill persuing an M.S. in Computer Science. I graduated from UNC in 2023 with a B.S. in Computer Science, a B.A. in Linguistics, and a Minor in Data Science.

I enjoy A.I. and Machine Learning in all forms, but especially NLP. You can see a handful of school-related projects here, the most notable of which is [Personality-Analysis-of-LMs](https://github.com/MasonLaney/Personality-Analysis-of-LMs), which contains (most) of the code for my undergraduate honors thesis.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or inquiries!
